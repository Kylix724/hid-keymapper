# HidKeymapper
A keyboard remapping tool, using Interception by oblitum.

With its use of the Interception API it can catch the Input early enough to make it work with most Applications that usually still process the original input. In addition, it supports multiple input devices at the same time, making it possible to use multiple devices with different shortcuts, as long as they have different Hardware Ids. 

## Installation
Download the base version of Interception from [here](https://github.com/oblitum/Interception/), follow the installation instructions for that. 

Then just execute hid-keymapper.exe
