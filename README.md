# Interception Keymapper
------------------------
A keyboard remapping tool, using Interception by oblitum.

With its use of the Interception API it can catch the Input early enough to make it work with most Applications that usually still process the original input. In addition, it supports multiple input devices at the same time, making it possible to use multiple devices with different shortcuts, as long as they have different Hardware Ids. 

And all that with a functional user interface sparing the user the dreadful experience of looking at text files.

## Installation
--------------------
Download the base version of Interception from [here](https://github.com/oblitum/Interception/), follow the installation instruction for that. 

Then just execute interception-keymapper.exe
